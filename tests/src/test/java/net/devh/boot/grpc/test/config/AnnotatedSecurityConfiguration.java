// You cannot avoid that warning (without massive amount of work), but it is safe to ignore it.
// The #bindService() method uses a reference to 'this', which will be used to invoke the methods.
// If the method is not final it will delegate to the original instance and thus it will bypass any security layer that
// you intend to add, unless you re-implement the #bindService() method on the outermost layer (which Spring does not).
