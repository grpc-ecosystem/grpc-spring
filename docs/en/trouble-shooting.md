## NoClassDefFoundError, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchMethodError, AbstractMethodError

### Example

````txt
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'client' defined in file [~/.../MyGrpcClient.class]: Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: io/grpc/TlsChannelCredentials$Feature
    at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.doCreateBean(AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.java:602)
    [...]
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: io/grpc/TlsChannelCredentials$Feature
    at io.grpc.netty.ProtocolNegotiators.<clinit>(ProtocolNegotiators.java:92)
````

### The Problem

The server/client does not start because some class or method is missing. \
This is usually the case if the grpc-libraries use slightly different versions.

### The solution

Make sure to use exactly the same version for all `grpc-java` versions.

Add the following entry to your `dependencyManagement` section of your project:

````xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
    <artifactId>grpc-bom</artifactId>
    <version>${grpcVersion}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
````

You can use a similar approach for gradle:

````groovy
dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom "io.grpc:grpc-bom:${grpcVersion}"
````

> **Note:** grpc-spring-boot-starter isn't strictly bound to a specific version of grpc-java, so you can also use this
> to change the version of grpc-java you are using in your project.

### The Problem

The server runs in `PLAINTEXT` mode, but the client tries to connect it in `TLS` (default) mode.

### The simple solution

a.k.a.: Configure the client to connect in `PLAINTEXT` mode (Not recommended for production).

Add the following entry to your client side application config:

````properties
grpc.client.__name__.negotiationType=PLAINTEXT
````

### The better solution

a.k.a.: Configure the server to run in `TLS` mode (Recommended).

Add the following entry to your sever side application config:

````properties
grpc.server.security.enabled=true
grpc.server.security.certificateChain=file:certificates/server.crt
grpc.server.security.privateKey=file:certificates/server.key
````

## First received frame was not SETTINGS

### Client-side

````txt
Status{code=INTERNAL, description=http2 exception, cause=...Http2Exception: First received frame was not SETTINGS. Hex dump for first 5 bytes: 485454502f
````

### The Problem

`485454502f` -> `HTTP/` from `HTTP/1.1`

You are probably connecting to a normal web server and not a HTTP/2 grpc server or proxy.

### The Solution

Check your address configuration. Make sure that you are connecting to the correct port.

e.g. `dns:///my-service.grpc.example` -> `dns:///my-service.grpc.example:12345`

## Network closed for unknown reason

### Client-side

````txt
io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: Network closed for unknown reason
````

### The Problem

You are either (1) trying to connect to an grpc-server in `TLS` mode using a `PLAINTEXT` client
or (2) the target is not a grpc-server (e.g. a web-server).

### The Solution

1. Configure your client to use `TLS` mode.

   ````properties
   grpc.client.__name__.negotiationType=TLS
   ````

   or remove the `negotiationType` config completely as `TLS` is the default.
2. Validate that the configured server is running and is a grpc-server using
   [`grpcurl`](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) or a similar tool.

## Could not find TLS ALPN provider

### Both sides

````txt
AbstractMethodError: io.netty.internal.tcnative.SSL.readFromSSL()
````

### The Problem

There is no (compatible) netty TLS implementation available on the classpath.

### The Solution

Either switch from [`grpc-netty`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.grpc/grpc-netty) to [`grpc-netty-shaded`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.grpc/grpc-netty-shaded)
or add a dependency to [`netty-tcnative-boringssl-static`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.netty/netty-tcnative-boringssl-static)
(Please use the **exact same** (compatible) versions that are listed in the table in [grpc-java's netty security section](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/SECURITY.md#netty).

> **Note:** You need a 64bit Java JVM.

## Dismatching certificates

### Client-side

````txt
io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: io exception
[...]
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: General OpenSslEngine problem
[...]
Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names present

or

````txt
io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: io exception
[...]
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: General OpenSslEngine problem
[...]
Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No name matching <name> found
````

### The Problem

The certificate does not match the target's address/name.

### The Solution

Configure an override for the name comparison by adding the following to your client config:

````properties
grpc.client.__name__.security.authorityOverride=<authority>
````

## Untrusted certificates

### Client-side

````txt
io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: io exception
[...]
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: General OpenSslEngine problem
[...]
Caused by: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
[...]
Caused by: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
````

### The Problem

The certificate used by the server is not in the trust store of the client.

### The Solution

Either add the certificate to java's truststore by using java's `keytool`
or configure the client to use a custom trusted certificate file:

````properties
grpc.client.__name__.security.trustCertCollection=file:certificates/trusted-servers-collection.crt.list
````

> **Note:** Both stores are currently read only at creation time and updates won't be picked up.

## Server port already in use

### Server-side

    ... 13 common frames omitted
Caused by: java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind
````

### The Problem

The port the grpc server is trying to use is already used.

There are four common cases where this error might occur.

1. The application is already running
2. Another application is using that port
3. The grpc server uses a port that is already used for something else (e.g. spring-web)
4. You are running tests and spring didn't shutdown the grpc-server after each test

### The Solution

1. Try searching for the application using the task manager or `jps`
2. Try searching for the port using `netstat`
3. Check/Change your configuration. This library uses port `9090` by default
4. Adding `@DirtiesContext` to your test classes and methods
   Please note that the error will only occur from the second test onwards,
   so you have to annotate the first one as well!

## Client fails to resolve domain name

### Client-side

````txt
WARN  io.grpc.internal.ManagedChannelImpl - [Failed to resolve name. status=Status{code=UNAVAILABLE, description=No servers found for `discovery-server:443`}
ERROR n.d.b.g.c.n.DiscoveryClientNameResolver - No servers found for `discovery-server:443`
````

### The Problem

The discovery service library or it's configuration failed to specify the scheme how `discovery-server:443` should be
resolved. If you don't have a service discovery, then the default is `dns`, but if you use a discovery service, then
that will be the default and thus failing to resolve that address.

The same applies to other libraries, such as tracing or reporting libraries, which report their results via grpc to an
external server.

### The Solution

- Configure the (discovery service) library to specify the `dns` scheme:
  e.g. `dns:///discovery-server:443`
- Search for invocations of `ManagedChannelBuilder#forTarget(String)` or `NettyChannelBuilder#forTarget(String)`
  (or similar methods) and make sure they use the `dns` scheme.
- Disable the service discovery for grpc services:
  `spring.autoconfigure.exclude=net.devh.boot.grpc.client.autoconfigure.GrpcDiscoveryClientAutoConfiguration`
- or create a custom `NameResolverRegistry` bean

See also [client target configuration](client/configuration.md#choosing-the-target).
